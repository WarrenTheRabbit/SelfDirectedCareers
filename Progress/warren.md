## Activity Update
- attended 1 AWS meetup and 1 Azure meetup
- applied to be an AWS Cloud Club captain
- became Assistant Organiser for _AWS Programming and Tools_
- received permission from Holberton to host events and give myself a title
- completed 'fine-tune a LLM goal'


## Network Update
- made contact with Yuri, Brad, Brandon*, Daghan, Adelle*
- four Microsoft employees added to my network
- two Azure Data Platform organisers added to my network

*: have not yet spoken in person

## I learned or was advised
- Don't spend time on low-value skills (HTML, CSS)
- Don't try to compete with long-standing expertise (e.g. SQL experts)
- Gain expertise in GenAI - it is new and there is an opportunity for a career
- Australia's university system is cloud, devop and agile skills poor
- The ability to network and understand people's needs will be an asset
- I can be successful at networking
- I have opportunities to present at AWS and Azure meetups

## What changed for me? I will try to...
- focus on GenAI
- help meetup organisers
- seek to add value to companies via cloud meetups and events
- teach others cloud skills to grow my skillset and appeal
- connect with people interested in community, cloud and GenAI
- connect with people that can teach me about tech and corporate culture
