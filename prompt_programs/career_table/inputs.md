This document stores the inputs to use with the [create your table](https://github.com/WarrenTheRabbit/SelfDirectedCareers/blob/main/automation.md#use-genai-to-create-your-table) program.
In my experience, it is easier to revise the input (which you then feed into the prompt) than it is to revise the markdown table output.
