This directory is for storing the customisable components of prompt program templates. 


### Motivation
The motivation for storing the customisable portion of a prompt template is that sometimes the input is in a format that is easier to work with than the format of the output.

For example, it is much easier to revise a list than it is to revise a markdown table. Consequently, if a prompt takes a list and turns it into a markdown table, it is sensible to persist the input list. That way, if you want to alter the markdown, you can just change the list and re-run the prompt.

### To Do
A next step is to store the prompt templates.
